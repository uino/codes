An arduino library to read the ADXL335 acceleration sensor from Adafruit.com

The library takes the raw input from the sensor and outputs all three axis in earth gravities.
The library is able to detect freefall as well as calculate the hypotenuse of the vector and all three angles; rho, phi, and theta.
